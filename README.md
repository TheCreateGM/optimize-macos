## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can modify these variables at the top of the script:

```bash
LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=7     # How many days of logs to keep
LARGE_FILE_SIZE_GB=1     # Size threshold for "large" files
DEFAULT_YES=false        # Set to true for default "yes" in prompts
VERBOSE=true             # Set to false to reduce output verbosity
RUN_ALL=false            # Set to true to run all tasks without prompting
SCRIPT_VERSION="1.0.0"   # Version of this script
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Interactive confirmations**: Every operation requires user approval
- **Non-destructive**: Most operations clear caches and temporary files
- **Backup recommendations**: Script advises creating backups before major changes
- **Graceful handling**: Continues even if individual operations fail
- **Error reporting**: Detailed status reporting for each operation
- **Initial system checks**: Verifies disk space before operations
- **OS version detection**: Ensures compatibility with your macOS version

## üìù Generated Files

The script may create diagnostic files on your Desktop:
- `app_crash_log_check_TIMESTAMP.txt` - Recent application crash logs
- `finder_log_check_TIMESTAMP.txt` - Finder-specific error logs
- Temporary files in system temp directories for operation processing

These files are automatically removed if no issues are found or when operations complete.

## üîÑ What Gets Cleared/Reset

### Temporary Files
- User and system caches
- Application saved states
- Temporary files in `/tmp` and `/var/tmp`
- Browser caches (Safari, Chrome, Firefox)
- Old diagnostic reports and crash logs

### System Databases
- Launch Services database
- Font cache
- DNS cache
- Spotlight index (rebuilt)

### System Preferences
- User interface settings (animations, smooth scrolling)
- Dock and window behavior settings
- Finder display preferences
- Crash reporter dialog settings

### Storage Cleanup
- Trash contents
- Old downloads (30+ days)
- iOS device backups
- iOS software updates
- Xcode derived data and archives
- Time Machine local snapshots

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Administrator Access**: The script requires sudo privileges for system-level operations
2. **Application Closure**: Close all apps before running for best results
3. **Restart Recommended**: Some changes require a system restart to take full effect
4. **Backup First**: Consider backing up important data before running extensive cleanups
5. **Network Configuration**: Wi-Fi fixes may require a system restart

## üö® Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Permission Denied**: Ensure you have administrator privileges
2. **Script Won't Run**: Check file permissions with `ls -la optimacos.sh`
3. **Operations Fail**: Some operations may fail on newer macOS versions due to system restrictions
4. **Verbose Mode**: Run with `--verbose` to see detailed command output for debugging
5. **Individual Functions**: Run specific functions using execution mode 3 to isolate issues
6. **Command Timeouts**: Some operations may time out on slower systems - increase timeout values in script if needed

## üîç Common Issues Fixed
